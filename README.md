## Features

- Next.js 13: Breadit leverages the power of Next.js 13, a highly efficient and versatile framework, to deliver fast and dynamic web pages. With its built-in server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities, Next.js ensures optimal performance and SEO-friendly content.

- Prisma: Breadit integrates Prisma, a modern database toolkit, to provide a robust and scalable data layer. Prisma simplifies database operations by offering a type-safe and intuitive API, allowing you to focus on building features rather than dealing with complex SQL queries.

- MySQL: Breadit utilizes MySQL as its database management system, ensuring reliable data storage and retrieval. MySQL's stability, security, and performance make it an ideal choice for handling large amounts of structured data.

- Tailwind CSS: Breadit embraces the power of Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, to create stunning and responsive user interfaces. Tailwind CSS provides a comprehensive set of pre-designed components and flexible styling options, empowering you to build beautiful and consistent designs with ease.

- Redis Caching: Breadit leverages Redis for caching to optimize performance and reduce database load. Redis, an in-memory data store, enables lightning-fast data retrieval, making Breadit a snappy and responsive platform for users.
